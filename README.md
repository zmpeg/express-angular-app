# CSV Explorer - Sample Express App using Angular
This sample app allows you to import a CSV and run some simple analysis on it.

## Setup

    npm install
    bower install

## Test

    npm test

## Run

    npm start

## TODO

 * Use browser file API for smoother CSV import
 * Tolerate column headers, do not include in analysis
 * Implement a better table style since angular-material does not include any.
 * Better error handling
 * Allow user to choose which column or row to run analysis on
 * Put up this app on a demo site
